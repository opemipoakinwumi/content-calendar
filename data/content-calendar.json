The Squatter\nYou're always living with someone, if you had a choice, you would move out, but every time you plan to, something unexpected happens that forces you postpone your plan.\n\n2.The Failed Planner\nYou start each month with a solid plan to save for rent. But then, a trip to Zanzibar here, Dorime at Quilox there and a little skincare restock. Before you know it, your rent savings have been diverted to fund your soft life.\n\n3. The Miracle Worker\nTwo weeks before rent is due, your bank account is empty. Yet, somehow, money appears just in time to cover the payment. You never quite understand how it happens it just does.\n\n4.The Oga have mercy gang\nYou’re probably a freelancer, tech creative or business owner, is not that you will not pay o,\nIt is that your money is always processing when rent is due, so you have to beg the landlord to give you small time.\n",

Jesus 10X, cause how did house rent go from 2M to 5M just because landlord changed your bathroom tap and painted the gate days ago?\n\n4. Calculator mode activated, energy,as the 500k in your account must cover rent, grocery shopping,and your monthly beauty maintenance.\n\n\n5. Call your mummy immediately.
